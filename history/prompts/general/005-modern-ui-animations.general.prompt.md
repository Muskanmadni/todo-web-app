  I have successfully implemented a modern UI with animations for the frontend application. The changes include:

  1. Added Framer Motion for animations
  2. Completely redesigned the UI with a modern aesthetic
  3. Added smooth transitions and animations throughout the application
  4. Improved the visual design with gradients, shadows, and better spacing
  5. Enhanced the user experience with micro-interactions

  Key improvements made:
  - Added a beautiful gradient background
  - Created smooth loading animations
  - Added animated transitions between login and register forms
  - Implemented staggered animations for task lists
  - Added hover animations and micro-interactions
  - Improved the overall visual design with better typography and spacing
  - Added animated feedback for user actions (task creation, updates, deletions)
  - Created a more engaging onboarding experience for new users

  The UI now features:
  - Smooth fade-in animations when components load
  - Animated transitions when switching between login and register forms
  - Hover animations on buttons and task items
  - Loading animations during API requests
  - Staggered animations for task lists
  - Visual feedback for completed tasks
  - Improved error display with animations
  - Modern card-based design with shadows and rounded corners
  - Gradient accents and improved color scheme
