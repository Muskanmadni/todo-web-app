# Prompt History Record: Professional UI Specification

## User Input

```
i want my ui professional for folder todo-frontend
```

## Response Summary

Created a comprehensive feature specification for implementing a professional UI for the todo-frontend application. The specification includes:

- User stories with priorities (P1-P3) covering professional theme implementation, responsive design, and accessibility
- Functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-008) defining the professional UI standards
- Success criteria (SC-001 through SC-005) with measurable outcomes
- A quality checklist confirming the specification meets all required standards

The specification follows the template structure and is written in a technology-agnostic way, focusing on user value and business needs rather than implementation details. The branch `003-professional-ui` was created for this work, and all mandatory sections are completed.

## Outcome

Specification is ready for the planning phase (`/sp.plan`). All validation criteria have been met according to the quality checklist in `specs/003-professional-ui/checklists/requirements.md`.
