# Prompt History Record: CLI Todo App Plan

## PROMPT_TEXT

```
i already itialize folder console-todo-app and i want you to working in only one file in main.py
```

## RESPONSE_TEXT

Created a comprehensive implementation plan for the CLI Todo Application with the following artifacts:

1. Implementation Plan (plan.md): Detailed technical context, constitution check, and project structure
2. Research Document (research.md): Technology decisions and rationale
3. Data Model (data-model.md): Task entity definition and in-memory storage structure
4. Quickstart Guide (quickstart.md): Setup and usage instructions
5. CLI Command Contracts (contracts/cli-commands.md): Interface specification for all commands

All artifacts follow the constitution requirements and are ready for the next phase (tasks creation). The plan specifies a single-file Python application (main.py) with console interface as requested.
