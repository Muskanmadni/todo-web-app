# Hackathon II – Evolution of Todo Constitution

## Core Principles

### Spec-Driven First
Specifications are the **single source of truth**. Code **MUST NOT** be written manually. Implementation **MUST ONLY** be generated by Claude Code from approved specs. Incorrect behavior requires **spec refinement**, not code edits.

### Engineer as Architect
Human role: **system architect**. AI role: **implementation engine**. Decisions are expressed via **specs**, not imperative coding.

### Mandatory Workflow (Non-Negotiable)
All development follows this sequence: Write or update specification → Explicitly reference specs using `@specs/...` → Ask Claude Code to implement → Test the output → If incorrect → **revise spec**, repeat. Skipping specs, writing code manually, and editing generated code directly are forbidden.

### Spec-Kit Structure Compliance
Each phase **MUST** include: Constitution, Feature specs, API specs (when applicable), Database specs (when applicable), UI specs (when applicable), and CLAUDE.md instructions. Specs must follow Spec-Kit conventions and be atomic, testable, phase-scoped, and free of unnecessary implementation detail.

### Phase Progression Integrity
Phases **MUST** be completed in order with no phase relying on future-phase features. Earlier phases **MUST remain functional**. Phase I: Console, in-memory only. Phase II: Web + persistence + auth. Phase III: AI + MCP tools. Phase IV: Local Kubernetes. Phase V: Cloud + event-driven + Dapr. Cloud in Phase I, AI in Phase II, and Kafka before Phase V are explicitly forbidden.

### Architecture Standards
Statelessness: Servers **MUST NOT** store session state in memory. State **MUST** persist in a database or external store (required from Phase III onward). Separation of Concerns: UI ≠ API ≠ AI logic ≠ Infrastructure. MCP tools expose **capabilities**, not business rules. Agents decide *when* to act; tools define *how*.

## Additional Constraints

### AI & Agent Rules (Phase III+)
Agents **MUST use tools** for all mutations. No hallucinated actions. Tool schemas are **strict contracts**. Agent behavior must be deterministic and spec-bound.

### Security & Data Isolation
Users **MUST only access their own data**. Authentication is mandatory where specified. Secrets **MUST NOT** be hard-coded. JWT verification is required for secured APIs.

### Cloud-Native Principles (Phase IV–V)
Containers are immutable. Configuration via environment variables or secrets. Infrastructure is declarative. Prefer **Dapr abstractions** over direct dependencies.

### Testing & Validation Rules
Acceptance criteria define "done". Behavior must be demonstrable (CLI, UI, chatbot). Specs must enable correct implementation **without guessing**.

## Development Workflow

### Language & Style Rules for Specs
Specs **MUST**: Use clear, unambiguous language. Use **MUST / SHOULD / MUST NOT**. Define inputs, outputs, and constraints. Avoid vague terms. Be understandable without reading code.

### Prohibited Actions
The following are **strictly forbidden**: Manual code writing, Bypassing specs, Mixing phase concerns, Editing generated code without spec updates, Undocumented features.

## Governance

In case of conflict: Spec vs implementation → **Spec wins**. Plan vs constitution → **Constitution wins**. Human instruction vs constitution → **Constitution wins**. All specifications, plans, agent behaviors, and generated code **must comply** with this Constitution.
