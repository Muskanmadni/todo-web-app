# Specification Quality Checklist: Full-Stack Todo App

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-26
**Feature**: [Link to spec.md](spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) - Specifications focus on what and why, not how
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs - All specs prioritize user scenarios and functionality
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders - Language is accessible and outcome-focused
- [x] All mandatory sections completed - Overview, architecture, CRUD, auth, API, database, UI pages, and components all specified

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain - All specifications have clear, testable requirements
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous - Each requirement can be verified independently
- [x] Success criteria are measurable - Specific metrics defined for feature success
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details) - Outcomes defined without tech stack references
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined - Clear Given/When/Then scenarios for user stories
- [x] Edge cases are identified - Potential boundary conditions and error scenarios documented
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded - In-scope and out-of-scope features clearly defined
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified - Technology stack and external services documented

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria - Each requirement linked to verification method
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows - Core user journeys prioritized and detailed
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria - Clear metrics for completion
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification - Focus maintained on functionality, not technology

## Notes

- All specifications are complete and ready for the planning phase
